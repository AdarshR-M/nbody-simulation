# N-Body Simulation
## TEAM ANYmation - Astrophysics Subsystem

This .blend file uses, python plugin to compute and animate n-body systems. The working principle is to calculate 
the orbits of each object using gravitational law. As the number of objects increases, the number of computations blast off, so it is 
not a viable method for more than 10 body systems. And it might not be very very accurate, so, it might not be accurate for 
long periods of time.
