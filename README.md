# N-Body Simulation
## TEAM ANYmation - Astrophysics Subsystem

This .blend file uses, python plugin to compute and animate n-body systems. The working principle is to calculate 
the orbits of each object using gravitational law. As the number of objects increases, the number of computations blast off, so it is 
not a viable method for more than 10 body systems. Its accuracy reduces as the number of bodies increases and also if the time duration is large.

This project was done by me, Ashwin Goyal and Tamojeet.
